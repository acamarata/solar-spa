## Scope

This package is a WASM-based computation library. It performs no network requests, reads no files, and holds no credentials. The primary security concern would be a memory safety issue in the WASM binary or a supply-chain compromise of the npm package.

The WASM binary is compiled from the [NREL SPA C source](https://midcdmz.nrel.gov/spa/) with Emscripten. The compiled output (`wasm/spa-module.js`) is checked into the repository so its contents can be audited directly.
